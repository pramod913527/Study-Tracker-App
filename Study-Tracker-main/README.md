I'mStudy Tracker App development 

Perfect — this is totally doable and you’ve already described everything needed for a production-grade, sellable product. I took your extra requirements (students can self-create full-day timetables, invite any guardians/mentors/teachers, multi-role logins, hierarchical developer→admin permissions, notifications on WhatsApp/Telegram/push, audit & anti-cheat) and turned them into a concrete production plan you can build from today.

Summary (what you want)

Any user (student or stand-alone person) can create a full-day timetable (00:00–23:59) with arbitrarily many slots.

Students must mark each slot (Start/Done) and data is timestamped server-side.

Students can invite any persons (parents, teacher, mentor, friend) to receive notifications and view reports.

Multi-role login system: Developer (super-admin) → Admin → Mentor/Teacher → Parent/Guardian → Student → Developer has highest privileges and grants admin; admins delegate other roles.

Production quality: scalable, secure, audit logs, retention & privacy settings, monetizable & multi-tenant.

Notification channels: WhatsApp Cloud API + Telegram + push + email. Consent and opt-in required.

Recommended Tech Stack (production-first)

Backend API: NestJS (TypeScript) — modular, testable, enterprise features

DB: PostgreSQL (managed RDS / Supabase) + Redis (queues, rate-limit, caching)

Auth: Keycloak or Auth0 / or Firebase Auth for OTP (but Keycloak/Auth0 better for RBAC in production)

Mobile: Flutter (single codebase for Android/iOS) — good for polished apps you’ll sell

Web Admin/Dashboard: React + Next.js (server side rendering for SEO + admin UX)

File Storage: S3 / GCS (signed URLs) for photos/evidence

Notifications: WhatsApp Cloud API (primary), Telegram Bot API (fallback), FCM for push, SMTP for email

Jobs: BullMQ + Redis (scheduling reminders, materialize sessions, digests)

Hosting/Infra: Kubernetes / Fly.io / Render + CI (GitHub Actions)

Analytics: ClickHouse or BigQuery for heavy analytics; Grafana/Sentry for observability



---

Role Hierarchy & Permission Model

Developer (super-admin) — create orgs, promote to Admin, system settings, billing, rotate keys.

Admin (org-level) — manage users in org, assign roles (mentor/teacher/parent/student), create org policies, approve templates.

Mentor / Teacher — create timetables for students or groups, view reports, nudge students.

Parent / Guardian — read-only access to assigned students’ summaries, receive notifications.

Student — create/edit own timetable (if allowed), mark sessions, upload proofs.

Guest / Observer — view-only (optional).


Use Role-Based Access Control + Row Level Security: each request must be checked for role + org context. Developer bypasses org scoping.


---

Key Data & Flow Additions

(Important tables/collections to support invites, roles, and hierarchical grants)

SQL tables (high level additions):

users(id, name, phone, email, tz, created_at)

roles(id, name) — developer/admin/mentor/parent/student

user_roles(user_id, role_id, org_id NULLABLE, granted_by, granted_at) — allows developer/global roles vs org roles

orgs(id, name, timezone, settings)

invitations(id, inviter_id, invitee_email_or_phone, role, org_id, token, status, expires_at) — sendable invite links

timetables(id, owner_id (student), visibility, created_at) — visibility: private, parents, mentors, org

slots(id, timetable_id, start_time, end_time, subject, recurrence_rule)

sessions(id, slot_id, date, status, planned_start_ts, planned_end_ts)

checkins(id, session_id, student_id, type, server_ts, device_meta, proof_url)

notifications(id, recipient_id, channel, payload, status, sent_ts)

audit_logs(id, actor_id, action, resource, payload, ts)


Invite flow

Student creates timetable → “Invite people” → enter phone/email and role (parent/mentor/etc.) → system creates invitations & sends WhatsApp/SMS/email with link → invited person accepts → user created (if new) and user_roles added.


Sharing & Visibility

Timetable visibility controls: Owner-only / Invited-only / Org-wide. Parents get read access by default when invited.



---

UI / UX flows (important)

1. Signup

Phone OTP + email optional. Developers require verification step (2FA).



2. Create Timetable

Choose full-day grid (00:00–23:59), add slots or bulk import.

For each slot: subject, duration, proof rule (none/selfie/OTC/quiz), recurrence.



3. Invite People

Enter phone/email + select role(s) to receive notifications.

Choose channels (WhatsApp/Telegram/push/email). Consent must be recorded.



4. Student Session

Notification pre-slot → Start → mid-session OTC (if enabled) → Done → server timestamp stored.



5. Notifications

Real-time message to invited persons with template: Student Name, Subject, Slot, On-time/Late, Timestamp, Note link.



6. Admin / Developer

Role management screen: grant/revoke roles, view audit logs, rotate API keys for WhatsApp.



7. Reports / Export

One-click export (PDF/CSV), scheduled daily digests via WhatsApp or email to parents & admins.





---

Anti-cheat & Evidence (practical)

Server timestamps authoritative. Client events accepted only within configured windows.

Optional proofs:

Selfie with liveness check (optional).

Photo of physical notebook (with optional on-device face blur when sharing).

Mini-quiz (1–2 MCQ) to confirm focus.

OTC randomly generated mid-session and shown on student app; they must submit it.


Flag anomalies: repeated instant completes, identical SSID evidence across many accounts (if collected), device clock tampering.

Provide manual review workflow for flagged records.



---

Notifications: WhatsApp specifics

Use WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta). Templates required and must be approved in advance.

Message templates you’ll need:

session_start: {{1}} started {{2}} ({{3}}–{{4}}) at {{5}}.

session_complete: {{1}} completed {{2}} ✅ at {{3}}. On-time: {{4}}

session_missed: Alert: {{1}} missed {{2}} ({{3}}–{{4}}).

daily_digest: Summary for {{1}} — Completed: {{2}}, Missed: {{3}}, On-time: {{4}}%


Maintain consent: store opt-in boolean per recipient + channel. Provide unsubscribe flows.



---

Scalability & Production Concerns

Multi-tenant isolation: org_id on all domain tables; use row-level security (Postgres RLS) to enforce access.

Horizontal scaling: stateless API + Redis/Queue workers for background jobs.

Rate limits & throttles on WhatsApp to avoid being blocked.

Monitoring: Sentry, Prometheus + Grafana, audit trails for compliance.

Backups & retention: backups for DB + retention policy (images short TTL unless a paid plan).

Security: encrypt PII at rest, TLS everywhere, rotate secrets via Vault.



---

Monetization & Go-to-Market ideas

Freemium: Basic features free (simple timetable + student marking, 1 guardian), paid plans unlock WhatsApp alerts, advanced analytics, multi-class management.

Schools/Coaching tier: per-student/month pricing with bulk discounts and SSO.

White-label: custom theming + custom domain for institutes.

Marketplace integrations: offer content packs (study plans, prepared timetables).

Affiliate / Referral: refer a school — get free months.



---

Roadmap (MVP → Production)

MVP (4–8 weeks)

Auth + roles (student/admin/parent)

Student mobile app: full-day timetables, Start/Done, server timestamps

Invite & notification via Telegram (fast) + FCM push

Basic reports: daily summary, weekly compliance %

Audit logs + basic anti-cheat window rules


v1 (2–3 months)

WhatsApp Cloud API integration & templates

Proof options (selfie/OTC)

Admin panel + role management + invitation flows

Scheduled digests, exports (CSV/PDF)

Billing & subscription


Scale (3–6 months)

Multi-tenant optimizations, advanced analytics (BigQuery), SSO, white-labeling, advanced privacy features



---

Example APIs (role management & invites)

POST /auth/otp/request

POST /auth/otp/verify → returns JWT + roles

POST /orgs (Developer/Admin)

POST /users/invite → { invitee: phone|email, role, org_id } → creates invitations, sends template

POST /invitations/:token/accept → completes signup; creates user & user_roles

POST /timetables → create full-day timetable (owner_id)

POST /slots/:id/complete → server timestamps, stores checkin

GET /students/:id/report?range=7d|30d

POST /roles/grant → { user_id, role, org_id } (admin/developer only)

GET /audit?filter=... (developer/admin)



---

Privacy & Legal

Store consent auditable (who opted in, when).

Allow export/delete personal data (GDPR/COPPA if minors).

Provide Terms + Privacy; parental consent flows for minors under legal age.



---

Next Practical Step (I’ll do this for you)

I recommend building the production scaffold with:

Backend: NestJS + Postgres + Redis

Mobile: Flutter

Notifications: WhatsApp Cloud API + Telegram + FCM


If you want, I can generate the following right now (choose any or I’ll start with Backend + DB schema):

1. Production-grade SQL schema (Postgres) including roles, invites, timetables, sessions, checkins, notifications, audit tables.


2. NestJS API skeleton with role middleware, auth stubs, endpoints above, and sample unit tests.


3. Flutter starter app (auth + create timetable + start/complete flow + local queueing).


4. WhatsApp template drafts and webhook handler sample code for NestJS.



Tell me which of the 4 to generate first (or say “all”), and I’ll create the files and code scaffolds for you immediately.




Phase-by-phase Product Plan — Database (20 phases), Backend (20 phases), Frontend (20 phases)

Perfect — below is a very detailed, no-feature-left-behind phased plan you can follow to build a production-grade, sellable Study Tracker on MERN (MongoDB / Express / React / Node). I split into 3 tracks (Database → Backend → Frontend), 20 phases each, with clear deliverables, acceptance criteria, and testing/checklist items so nothing is missed. Use this as your project blueprint and tick each phase off as you go.

> Tip: work top-to-bottom per track (finish DB phases first), but you can parallelize once early APIs & models exist.

Next practical steps I can do for you right now

(I won’t perform work later — I’ll give it to you now if you want.)

Generate Phase DB-01 deliverable: a users Mongoose schema + seed script + validation tests.

Or generate Phase BE-01: Node/Express scaffold with OTP auth endpoints + Postman collection.

Or generate Phase FE-02: React Auth pages (source code) + storybook components.


Tell me which single phase artifact you want me to produce now (e.g., “DB-01 Mongoose schema” or “BE-01 auth scaffold” or “FE-05 timetable editor UI code”) and I’ll generate the code/spec immediately.



Perfect 👍 I’ll break Integration + Testing + Deployment into 20 detailed production-ready phases, so that after completing DB + Backend + Frontend phases, you’ll know exactly how to finish and launch the project without missing a step.
